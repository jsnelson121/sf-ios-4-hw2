// iOS4 Assessment 2

// Complete the following @todos. Write your code
// immediately below the relevant instructions.

// 1. Write a variable to hold the name of a dog and
//    set its value to a dog's name

var dogName = "Lassie"

// 2. Write a variable to hold the duration of a movie
//    in minutes and set its value

var movieRunTime:Double = 120

// 3. Write a variable to hold whether it is daytime
//    and set it to reflect that it is nighttime

var isDayTime = false

// 4. Write a constant to store PI (3.14159)

let pi:Double = 3.14159

// 5. Write a constant to store your favorite holiday

let myFavoriteHoliday = "Christmas Day"

// 6. Print out a message to the console saying 
//    "My favorite holiday is ___" 
//    (fill in the blank using the variable from #5)

print("My favorite holiday is \(myFavoriteHoliday).")


// 7. Store your first and last names in constants.
//    Use String concatenation to store your full
//    name in a constant called name

let firstName = "James"
let lastName = "Nelson"

var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

// 8. Use String interpolation to write a message
//    greeting yourself, i.e. "Hello ____ _____"
//    using the name variable from #7

print("Hello " + "\(fullName)")


// 9. Write a multiline comment explaining the
//    difference between ints, floats, and doubles

/*
ints are whole positive or negative numbers
floats are specific numbers with decimals; typically more exact than doubles
doubles are fractions with decimals
*/

// 10. Write a single line comment reminding yourself
//    of the action item to submit this homework.

// 11. Declare an optional String called religion
//     and do not provide a value

// 12. Declare an optional variable for an hourly rate
//     and set it equal to a dollar and cents amount

// 13. Print out the hourly rate to the console using
//     String interpolation, making sure it does not 
//     show "Optional(__)" in the output.

// 14. Using the variable from #3, write a conditional
//     that prints "Hello!" to the console if it is day
//     and "Goodnight!" to the console if it is night

// 15. Using the variable from #2, write a conditional
//     that says "too short" if it is less than an hour,
//     "too long" if it is more than two hours, and
//     "just right" if it is between the two

// 16. Create two constants a and b and set them equal 
//     to 5 and 7, respectively.

// 17. Create a variable sum that computes the sum from #16

// 18. Create a variable difference that computes a minus b.

// 19. Create a variable product that computes a times b.

// 20. Create a variable quotient that computes a divided
//     by b.
